Trading&mdash;speculative bet making&mdash;is a special topic to me. I spent about 3.5 years in love with trading and making it my mission to become a professional trader. My regard for the practice, particularly the ubiquitous professional institution of it, eventually shifted to disappointment. I still think it's a fascinating concept, and I'm quite glad for the experience&mdash;both for many reasons. It's also a ton of fun. But I can't in good faith encourage people to immerse themselves in trading. There are too many creative, useful, _and_ lucrative opportunities to enjoy to live trapped in the minutiae of a pointless game. Make no mistake, however: investing, a related but separate topic, is of course legitimate and worthwhile. The reason one makes sense and the other doesn't is time. Trading consumes lots of time, distracting you from other great things and diminishing the quality of your experience. Investing does not require your constant attention, it pays you to be frugal and pragmatic&mdash;it makes your time worth more because it's more free. Less time can be afforded to income-generating duties and more to the manifestation of dreams.

Here are some things I learned from trading. You'll notice, however, that they extend beyond just that.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even your deeply held convictions. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabalistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty. You never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people are really bothered by needing to admit wrongness, but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's perfectly okay to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Not a single person or thing, ever, has been right about everything. So nobody has good reason to pretend they know the answer to everything and that they can't possibly be wrong. Paradoxically, it's those who are willing to admit wrongness who often do adapt and collect relevant facts to repair their misconceptions and develop more complete understandings; they embrace wrongness to become more right. They're also better people, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. If you're not sure about something, just do half. The simplest heuristic is a very effective one. Again, given the constant threat of uncertainty, adjusting commitment to some plan when it becomes more or less effective is best for providing exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while ensuring there are few disasters.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you will notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial "common knowledge." Analyst upgrades/downgrades are not good predictors of accelerated growth/collapses. Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Most egregiously, the market is most certainly _not_ efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average, not after 1 or 2 rolls of the dice, but thousands, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates just ignore this glaring contradiction.) And Buffett's strategy may have been effective 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior value investing is to momentum-based strategies in the market now. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so much in finance because there is a direct incentive to trick other participants into having the wrong view (so they will take your bet and you win). But, even without the zero-sum incentives that are unique to finance, it happens elsewhere too. Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it.
