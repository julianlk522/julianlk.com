Speculative trading is a special topic to me. For those who don't know, I spent about 3.5 years in love with trading and making it my mission to become a professional trader. My mindset eventually shifted to feeling disappointment in the institution of professional speculation, especially given how popular it is. I still think it's a fascinating concept, and I'm quite glad for the experience&mdash;both for many reasons. It's also a ton of fun. But I can't in good faith encourage someone to pursue it while virtually any other activity would be more worthwhile. Make no mistake, however: investing, a related but separate topic, is absolutely legitimate and worthwhile.

Here are the things I learned from trading:

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even your deeply held convictions. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabalistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty. You never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong.

2. If you're not sure about something, just do half. Again, given the omnipotent threat of uncertainty, this is the best choice to ensure longterm disaster protection.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you will notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial "common knowledge." Analyst upgrades/downgrades are not consistent predictors of accelerated growth/collapses. Trend reversals often occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Most egregiously, the market is most certainly _not_ efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some people have come away winners, not after 1 or 2 rolls of the dice, but thousands? I will never understand the lunacy of this argument.) And Buffett's strategy may have been effective 50 years ago, but a 1-hour presentation from any competent pro trader or growth investor of their methods and results will quickly illuminate how vastly inferior value investing is to momentum-based strategies in today's market. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so much in finance because there is a direct incentive to trick other participants into having the wrong view (so they will take your bet and you win). But, even without the zero-sum incentives that are unique to finance, it happens elsewhere too. Don't believe it just because so-and-so said it.
