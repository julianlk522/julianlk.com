Relatively brief, speculative ownership of things. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this elementary concept, making it my mission to become a professional. Over time I felt disillusioned by it. I've come to hold both strongly positive and strongly negative feelings, which I describe here.

The extreme psychological warzone against emotion and reason, crawling with traps to elicit and punish any type of flirtation with irrationality, promising to grant life-changing freedom to the astute and impartial, is an intriguing circumstance that I'm glad to have experienced closely. It's very nicely meritocratic aside from the rampant manipulation and insider trading. That sounds sarcastic but I do sincerely appreciate the principles of equity and autonomy that define participation in contemporary financial markets. Everyone can operate exactly as they want to, adjusting the duration, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of their art to be just right. The market doesn't care who you are or what you've done in the past; making the right decisions today is all that matters. If you take a day off, or you're a convicted felon, or even if you're a woman, a human is likely to be biased on some level by knowing that information, but the market will not know or care. Nearly any blend of strategic preferences produces stunning success with proper discipline and craftsmanship, and bias will not gatekeep the results from conforming to what is fair.

It can be a great time. That said, finance has to be the biggest brain- and motivation-drain ever, while being basically pointless outside of offering individuals more agency. There are way too many creative, useful, _and_ lucrative opportunities to choose for it to be worth living trapped in the minutiae of a pointless game just for agency. We can do better.

Make no mistake: investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile since it doesn't (or shouldn't) take up all of your time.

So basically while I admit that trading is pretty awesome, I discourage it because other fixations are better.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading. You'll notice a theme. You'll also notice that their implications extend beyond just where they were first considered.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even your deeply held convictions. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabalistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty. You'll never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people are really bothered by acknowledgment of their own wrongness but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's perfectly okay to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Not a single person or thing, ever, has been right about everything. So nobody has good reason to pretend they know all the answers and can't possibly be wrong. Paradoxically, it's people who are willing to admit wrongness who can go on to achieve more complete understandings because their open-mindedness permits collecting new, relevant facts that power adaptation; they embrace wrongness to become more right. They're also more likeable, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. If you're not sure about something, just do half. This simple heuristic is surprisingly effective. You can keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's a bit too much doubt, or make other arbitrarily sized partial bets that better match your appetite for risk. Again, the constant threat of uncertainty: you must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. Frequently adjusting commitment to various plans based on rolling efficacy metrics works well to provide exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while ensuring a minimum number of disasters.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you will notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial "common knowledge." Analyst upgrades/downgrades are not good predictors of accelerated growth/collapses. Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Most egregiously, the market is clearly _not_ efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after not 1 or 2 rolls of the dice but thousands, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) And a Buffett-like strategy may have been effective 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior value investing is to momentum-based strategies in the market now. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so often in finance because there is a direct incentive to trick other participants into having the wrong view (so they will take your bet and you win). But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread. (Increasingly, sadly.) Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it. Research it genuinely and you will know the answer.
