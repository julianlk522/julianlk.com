Relatively brief, speculative ownership of things. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this seemingly elementary concept, making it my mission to become a professional. Over time I felt disillusioned by it. I've come to hold both strongly positive and strongly negative feelings, which I describe here.

The extreme psychological warzone against emotion and reason, crawling with traps to elicit and punish any type of flirtation with irrationality, promising to grant life-changing freedom to the astute and impartial, is an intriguing circumstance that I'm glad to have experienced closely. It's obviously extreme, which I like, but it's also very nicely meritocratic aside from the rampant manipulation and insider trading. That sounds sarcastic but, sincerely, the principles of equity and autonomy that define contemporary participation in financial markets are great. Everyone can operate exactly as they want to, adjusting the duration, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of their art to be just right. The market doesn't care who you are or what you've done in the past, making the right decisions today is all that matters. If you take a day off, or you're a convicted felon, or even if you're a woman, a person is likely to be biased on some level by knowing that information; not your online broker, who is equally incentivized to serve anyone wanting to do business. Bias does not gatekeep outcomes from conforming to what is fair (mostly). And nearly any blend of strategic preferences produces stunning success with proper discipline and craftsmanship.

(Perhaps this was what opened my mind to finding meaning and delight in tech. These beautiful freedoms are really there because of the tech, not so much the rules of finance.)

Trading can be a great time. Through all the headache-inducing blinking lights, screenshotting charts, tediously scoring the rationality of every single transaction I made on a 1-to-10 scale, spreadsheets, etc., I never got bored of it. I think it came naturally&mdash;more than most other things I have tried&mdash;which added to the fun and the eventual stew of mixed feelings about the whole thing.

All that said, finance has to be the biggest brain- and motivation-drain ever, while being basically pointless outside of being fun and easy and paying well. There are way too many creative, useful, _and_ fun, _and_ lucrative opportunities to choose for it to be worth living trapped in pointless minutiae just for some easy money. We can do better.

Make no mistake: investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile since it doesn't (or shouldn't) take up all of your time.

Trading is also pretty isolating and depressing, particularly if you're operating independently and/or not good about meeting people through non-work channels. Your computer monitor isn't a very good conversationalist (not mine, at least). How much is there really to discuss about your work anyway? "Number went up today! Down yesterday..." The only people who will ever understand or care about what you do are other traders, and they probably won't care either unless they think there is something to learn from you. If you decide to play, better play to win!

So basically while I admit that trading is pretty awesome, I discourage it. In the short term, sure. It can change your life for the better, as it did for me. Don't waste your lifetime on it.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading. You'll notice a theme. You'll also notice that their implications extend beyond just where they were first considered.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even your deeply held convictions. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabilistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty. You'll never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people are really bothered by acknowledgment of their own wrongness but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's perfectly okay to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Not a single person or thing, ever, has been right about everything. So nobody has good reason to pretend they know all the answers and can't possibly be wrong. Paradoxically, those who are willing to admit and even embrace wrongness are those who become most consistently correct. Their open-mindedness permits collecting new, relevant facts that can adapt any misconceptions. They're also more likeable, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. If you're not sure about something, just do half. This simple heuristic is surprisingly effective. You can keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's a bit too much doubt, or make other arbitrarily sized partial bets that better fit your appetite for risk. Again, the constant threat of uncertainty: you must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. Frequently adjusting commitment to various plans based on rolling efficacy metrics works well to provide exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while ensuring a minimum number of disasters.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you will notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial and other "common knowledge." Analyst upgrades/downgrades are not good predictors of accelerated growth/collapses. Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Most egregiously, the market is clearly not efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after not 1 or 2 rolls of the dice but thousands, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) And Buffett-style value investing may have been a leading strategy 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior value investing is to momentum-based strategies in the market today. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so often in finance because they are directly incentivized to trick other participants into having the wrong view (so they will take the opposite bet and win). But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread. Increasingly, sadly. Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it, research it genuinely and you will know the answer.

4. There are natural ups and downs, react accordingly. (This may be more or less relevant to you personally.) In a Taoist sort of way, there is a permanent ebb and flow in the ease of experiencing normal motions. Good days and bad days. Typically they cluster in distribution rather than forming stripes; that is, you have your good days and bad days in a row. So when a couple bad days happen at once, expect more to come. What that means in finance is, "place smaller bets." The opposite also holds: on a hot streak, it's rational to size-up bets because skill and resulting performance truly do increase along with confidence. It's the same in other matters if you [consider decisions with non-monetary outcomes to also be bets](../quotes#:~:text="Everyone,Thinking), which they absolutely are. If what you're doing isn't working, do less of it, and if you're killing it then accelerate. This advice seems on paper too reactionary and not predictive enough to approximate optimal posturing in the present, but it works pretty well.

5. One trade never defines someone's success, but one trade can bring demise. "Never marry a trade" is another way I've heard it put. What largely determines long term outcomes is how much you can (and do) participate. [*Generic 10,000 hours spiel*]. Regular participation provides sustained exposure to compound growth, whose magic powers cannot be overstated. Significant setbacks that suspend you from the game will obstruct spectacular growth much more so than not getting the full 100% value out of every day. It is way more important to not "lose everything at once" than it is to "gain everything at once." Taken literally, this means avoid trading where there is conceivable catastrophic potential, _even if_ the benefit of being right would also be great. There is also an abstract lesson: notable growth occurs over time, not usually in one all-night binge. It takes a long time for your brain to make the connections that let you intuitively understand and effectively engage with something, or for you to consider it somehow from an angle of particular personal significance such that you feel like you finally "get" it. And often if you do try to binge-practice (or binge-study, binge-build, binge-play, etc.) it leads to burnout and the desire to detach completely, which stalls the iterative process _and_ lets pending progress you've made get forgotten. That's like simultaneously decreasing the coefficient and exponent of a term in a polynomial&mdash;no bueno. Much better to prioritize avoiding total destruction than to prioritize capitalizing 100% on everything. There are a lot of opportunities... way more than enough. No need to trap yourself by promising unwavering devotion to any of them.
