Relatively brief, speculative ownership of things. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this seemingly elementary concept, making it my mission to become a professional. I felt increasingly disillusioned by it. I now hold both strongly positive and strongly negative feelings which I describe here.

The extreme psychological warzone against emotion and reason, crawling with traps to elicit and punish any type of flirtation with irrationality, promising to grant life-changing freedom to the astute and impartial, is an intriguing circumstance that I'm glad to have experienced up close.

It's extreme, which I often prefer.

It's fair. Yes there is rampant manipulation and insider trading, but surprisingly that doesn't diminish the positives that much for rule-abiding players.

It's tolerant of individual needs and preferences. The market is sufficiently generous in opportunity that a trader, as long as they are disciplined and exercise craftsmanship, may viably produce wild success from a full spectrum of tactical options. Direct market participants (those not operating through a job or other social commitment) have full control to adjust the duration, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of their practice to suit their desires.

And it is not personally biased. Making the right decisions today is all that matters for you as a trader. If you don't go to work one day, or you're a convicted felon, or even if you're a woman, a person is likely to be biased on some level by knowing that information. Not your online broker, who is equally incentivized to serve anyone wanting to do business. Bias does not gate-keep outcomes from conforming to what is fair (mostly).

Looking back, I think these beautiful freedoms are what opened my mind to finding meaning and delight in tech. They appear in trading because of its contemporary tech, not because of the rules of finance.

Trading can be fun. Through all the headache-inducing blinking lights, screenshotting charts, tediously scoring the rationality of all transactions I made on a 1-to-10 scale, spreadsheets, etc., I never got bored of it. I think it came naturally&mdash;more than most other things I have tried&mdash;which added to the fun and the eventual stew of mixed feelings about the whole thing.

All that said, finance has to be the biggest brain- and motivation-drain ever, while being basically pointless outside of being fun and easy and paying well. There are way too many creative, useful, _and_ fun, _and_ lucrative opportunities to choose for it to be worth living trapped in pointless minutiae just for some easy money. We can do better.

Trading is also pretty isolating and depressing, especially if you **1)** operate independently and/or **2)** are not good at meeting people through non-work channels. Your computer monitor isn't a very good conversationalist (not mine, at least). How much is there really to discuss about your work anyway? "Number went up today! Down yesterday..." The only people who will ever understand or care about what you do are other traders, and they probably won't care either unless they think there is something to learn from you. If you decide to play, better play to win!

So basically while I admit that trading is pretty awesome, I discourage it. In the short term, sure. It can change your life for the better, as it did for me. Don't waste your lifetime on it.

Make no mistake however: investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile since it doesn't (or shouldn't) take up all of your time.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading. You'll notice a theme. You'll also notice that their implications extend beyond just where they were first considered.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even deeply held convictions. A probabilistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty, rather than complete faith in your best guess. You'll never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people hate to acknowledge their own wrongness but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's fine to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Nobody gets everything right, nor can they predict what they will be wrong about, so therefore nobody should ever act under faith that they must be right about something. Paradoxically, those who are willing to admit and even embrace wrongness are those who become most consistently correct. Open-mindedness admits new, relevant facts that can adapt misconceptions. Open-minded people are also more fun, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. A simple heuristic that is surprisingly effective: if unsure, just do half. You may keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's too much doubt, or make arbitrarily sized partial bets in tune with your shifting audacity. I'll say it again: constant uncertainty. You must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. You are always making bets in a sense, and they need not (and should not) often be all-or-nothing. Frequently adjusting commitment to various plans, based on rolling efficacy metrics and even gut feelings, works well to provide exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while keeping disasters to a minimum.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you'll notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial and other "common knowledge." Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Analyst upgrades/downgrades are completely useless as trend signals. Most egregiously, the market is clearly not efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after thousands of rolls of the dice, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) And value investing a la Buffett may have been a dominant strategy 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior it is to momentum-based strategies in today's volatile market. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so often in finance because they are incentivized to trick other participants into having the wrong view. Those traders pay them their paycheck. But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread. Increasingly, sadly. Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it, research it genuinely and you will know the answer.

4. There are natural ups and downs, react accordingly. (This may be more or less relevant to you personally, but overall is an inevitable fact.) Good days and bad days. Typically they cluster together, so when a couple bad days happen at once, expect more. What that means in finance is, "when you start losing more, place smaller bets." The opposite also holds: on a hot streak, it's rational to size-up bets because skill and resulting performance truly do increase along with confidence. It's the same in other matters if you [consider decisions with non-monetary outcomes to also be bets](../quotes#:~:text="Everyone,Thinking), which they absolutely are. Do less of what doesn't work and more of what does. On paper, this advice seems too reactionary and not predictive enough to forecast optimal posturing in the present. But it works pretty well... this touches on another important lesson: simple is best.

5. The function for growth is exponential, and due to the properties of compounding, consistency is much more important than optimization. (This assumes past growth aides future growth, which should be true 99.9% of the time in serious undertakings.) Large exponents are worth more than large coefficients. Significant setbacks that halt participation, removing the exponent term altogether, obstruct growth much more than failing to capture all daily value, or decreasing the term coefficients. Career-defining success must be gradual but career-ending failure can be instant. In that way they are fundamentally asymmetrical. The threat of failure requires attention more than prospects for success do. It's totally okay to mess up&mdash;but you _\*must\*_ acknowledge it and not let it become lethal. Noteworthy success usually won't come from one trade or all-night binge. It comes from building on itself. Usually the exponent starts low; you can only grow so fast even if you work tirelessly and make perfect decisions. You still need to form the right neural pathways to engage something effectively, or build up enough capital to trade how you want, etc. Even if you are proficient, motivated, or otherwise capable binge-practicing (or -studying, -building, -playing, etc.) can still cause resentment and the desire to detach, which is no fun and obviously sucks for growth. So it is always better to try to not "lose everything at once" than try to "gain everything at once." Prioritize avoiding total destruction, optimize only with leftover bandwidth. There are a lot of opportunities... way more than enough. No need to doom yourself by promising unwavering devotion to any of them.
