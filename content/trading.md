Quick(ish), speculative ownership. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this seemingly simple concept, hungry to master it and use it as a lever to control my life. Over time, I felt increasingly disillusioned by it. I now hold both strongly positive and strongly negative feelings, described here.

Trading is a psychological war zone. It's swarming with traps to provoke harmful emotions, like fear or greed or anger, that elicit irrational, fatal decisions. On the other hand, it promises to grant life-changing freedom to those who are impartial, analytical, and disciplined.

An extreme, even beautiful, game which seems almost like a training ground for rationality.

The best parts, in my opinion:

-   **Fairness**. Yes there's rampant manipulation and insider trading, but surprisingly those don't diminish the positives much for honest players. Consider the issue of personal discrimination. If you don't go to work one day, or you're a convicted felon, or even if you're a woman, a person may likely be somewhat biased and act somewhat differently knowing that. Not your online broker. They're incentivized to serve everyone and will generally do that. You, as a result of trading's objective governance, always have the freedom to work and further yourself if you have capital. So making good decisions today is all that matters, not past decisions or things outside of your control, like age, skin color, etc.

-   **Accommodates productivity/strategy preferences**. There's enough opportunity in the market that wild success can be built from a broad spectrum of tactics. Some strategies definitely suck, but there are many that don't. You can adjust trade durations, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of the practice as needed or desired. (Unless trading for a job or other external organization that imposes its own rules, of course. All benefits are most applicable when trading independently.)

-   **Economically efficient**. (Not markets themselves as in [EMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), but the industry of trading in them.) Trading gives decisive, motivating results. You either _really_ fail and are forced to adapt or quit by the pain of idly hemorrhaging money, or you _really_ succeed and are rewarded a ton for doing something well. Everyone is strongly incentivized to work on what they're good at, or get better fast if they've found it but are still struggling. All (competitive) jobs should be that way, but most currently can't because they exist under bureaucracies that safeguard certain people from failure, e.g., incompetent CEOs won't get fired. Even billionaire traders [flunk out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator) if they screw up.

These are all basically about **meritocracy and rationality**, things any serious person should want. Well-invested effort is the only consistent source of reward. That rule doesn't change no matter who your parents are or what they did or didn't do for you. People are taught that everyone deserves to put in effort and if they do then great things will happen&mdash;exactly as it should be.

Shortly before quitting full-time stock trading in late 2021, I noticed these tie back to technology, not finance. I had thought of programmed systems as soulless tools for completing laborious work, but there are philosophical benefits too in integrating with tech. It's imperative in overcoming the pitfalls of human bias, for one thing, and can perhaps even teach us to be less biased.

Trading is crazy, unpredictable, and exhilarating. Through all the headache-inducing blinking lights, screenshotting charts, tediously scoring the rationality of all transactions I made from 1-to-10, spreadsheets, etc., I was rarely bored. You can never master it concretely, there is always something to improve. And I think it came more naturally to me than most things, which added to the fun and eventual stew of mixed feelings.

OK, now the negatives.

It's pretty isolating and depressing, especially if you **1)** trade independently and/or **2)** are not good at meeting people through non-work channels. Your computer monitor isn't a very good conversationalist (not mine, at least). How much is there really to discuss about the work anyway? "Number went up today! Down yesterday..." The only people who will ever understand or care about what you do are other traders, and they probably won't care either unless they think there is something to learn from you. If you decide to play, better play to win!

Finance also has to be the biggest brain- and motivation-drain ever. If you consider that it's only purpose 99%+ of the time is to (selectively) enrich, which can also be done in exchange for intrinsically valuable work like flying planes or making food, it seems obvious that those things are better uses of time than just making money to make money. Arguably, for that reason, trading is pointless. Some will contend that you should first make money however necessary and then retire to do all the things you love or be altruistic, or maybe instead that trading should exist as a fallback option when you can't find other work. These are excuses to be lazy and contribute to culture-rot. There are way too many creative, useful, _and_ fun, _and_ lucrative opportunities for it to be worth living trapped in pointless minutiae at a heavy [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost). The only unique benefit of finance is that it's _not_ creative, you just rinse-and-repeat the same plan every day and hardly ever have to imagine anything original. It's very easy that way. Do you want the defining quality of your work to be easiness?

So while I admit that trading can be great, I discourage it.

Make no mistake: investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile, mainly since it doesn't (or shouldn't) take up all of your time so there is not such an opportunity cost. In fact, it's the opposite: it makes your time worth more.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading, which I believe to be broadly applicable. You'll notice a theme.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even deeply held convictions. A probabilistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty, rather than complete faith in your best guess. You'll never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people hate to acknowledge their own wrongness but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's fine to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Nobody gets everything right, nor can they predict what they will be wrong about, so therefore nobody should ever act under faith that they must be right about something. Paradoxically, those who are willing to admit and even embrace wrongness are those who become most consistently correct. Open-mindedness admits new, relevant facts that can adapt misconceptions. Open-minded people are also more fun, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault or compromise is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. Assuming you want long-term success (hopefully so), it's not enough to think about successes as binary (yes/no). More important than outcome, did you have an informed game plan, and how well did you adhere to it? It's possible to be rewarded for bad choices and punished for good choices, but not for too long. Long term results conform to probabilities. How do you figure out the probabilities? Research your key metrics, a lot. In trading, the big question is, "what are the best leading indicators of good potential trades?" Which variables have the most collinearity with unusually favorable price fluctuation? Answer this and use the answer to form a plan for identifying strong candidates for trades. Focusing on "process over profits" (much-repeated saying about this) was crucial for me in eventually making lasting progress at trading after several years of losing at trading or experiencing only temporary success. I reviewed hundreds of stock charts that retrospectively produced trade-worthy conditions (volatility + liquidity, in short), scrutinized them on various timeframes for common behaviors, aligned my strategies with the most frequent observations, and henceforth evaluated myself only on adherence to these formulaic strategies and not on short-term results.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you'll notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial and other "common knowledge." Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Analyst upgrades/downgrades are completely useless as trend signals. Most egregiously, the market is clearly not efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after thousands of rolls of the dice, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) And value investing a la Buffett may have been a dominant strategy 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior it is to momentum-based strategies in today's volatile market. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so often in finance because they are incentivized to trick other participants into having the wrong view. Those traders pay them their paycheck. But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread. Increasingly, sadly. Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it, research it genuinely and you will know the answer.

4. A simple, surprisingly effective heuristic: if unsure, just do half. You may keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's too much doubt, or make arbitrarily sized partial bets in tune with your shifting audacity. I'll say it again: constant uncertainty. You must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. You are always making bets in a sense, and they need not (and should not) often be all-or-nothing. Frequently adjusting commitment to various plans, based on rolling efficacy metrics and even gut feelings, works well to provide exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while keeping disasters to a minimum.

5. The function for growth is exponential, and due to the properties of compounding, consistency is much more important than optimizing each iteration. (This assumes past growth aids future growth, which should be true 99.9% of the time in serious undertakings.) Large exponents are worth more than large coefficients. Significant setbacks that halt participation, removing the exponent term altogether, obstruct growth much more than failing to capture all daily value, or decreasing the term coefficients. Career-defining success must be gradual but career-ending failure can be instant. They are fundamentally asymmetrical that way. So the threat of failure requires attention more than prospects for success do. It's totally OK to mess up&mdash;you just can't let it spiral into something lethal. Noteworthy success usually won't come from one trade or all-night binge. More likely it will be marginal gains compounding. Usually the exponent starts low; you can only grow so fast even if you work tirelessly and make perfect decisions. You still need to form the right neural pathways to engage something effectively, or build up enough capital to trade how you want, etc. Even if you are proficient, motivated, or otherwise capable, binge-practicing (or -studying, -building, -playing, etc.) can still cause resentment and the desire to detach, which is no fun and obviously sucks for growth. So it is always better to try to not "lose everything at once" than try to "gain everything at once." Prioritize avoiding total destruction, optimize only with leftover bandwidth. There are a lot of opportunities... way more than enough. No need to doom yourself by promising unwavering devotion to any of them.

6. There are natural ups and downs, react accordingly. (This may be more or less relevant to you personally, but overall is an inevitable fact.) Good days and bad days. Typically they cluster together, so when a couple bad days happen at once, expect more. What that means in finance is, "when you start losing more, place smaller bets." The opposite also holds: on a hot streak, it's rational to size-up bets because skill and resulting performance truly do increase along with confidence. It's the same in other matters if you [consider decisions with non-monetary outcomes to also be bets](../quotes#:~:text="Everyone,Thinking), which they absolutely are. Do less of what doesn't work and more of what does. On paper, this advice seems too reactionary and not predictive enough to forecast optimal posturing in the present. But it works pretty well... this touches on another important lesson: simple is best.
