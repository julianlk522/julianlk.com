Relatively short, speculative ownership of things. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this elementary concept, making it my mission to become a professional trader. Over time I felt disillusioned by it. I've now come to hold both strongly positive and strongly negative feelings, which I describe here.

The extreme psychological warzone against emotion and reason, replete with traps poised to elicit and punish any flirtation with irrationality, and promising to grant life-changing freedom to the wise, is an intriguing circumstance that I'm quite glad to have experienced closely. The market is also beautifully meritocratic, aside from the rampant manipulation and insider trading. That sounds sarcastic but I do sincerely enjoy and respect the principles of equity and autonomy that define participation in this system. Everyone can operate exactly as they want to, adjusting the duration, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of their art to be just right, and each blend can be immensely effective if approached with proper scrutiny and craftsmanship.

It can be a great time. That said, finance has to be the biggest brain- and motivation-drain ever, while being basically pointless outside of offering individual agency. There are way too many creative, useful, _and_ lucrative opportunities to choose for it to be worth living trapped in the minutiae of a pointless game just for agency. We can do better.

Make no mistake: investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile. Time is the (main) reason investing makes sense but trading doesn't. Trading eats lots of time, which we obviously all prefer to have more of. It can become more hands-off at a higher skill level, but initially internalizing fundamental trading instincts takes large commitments in time, effort, and disposable income. Investing does too although constant attention is not needed. It hardly requires _any_ attention as long as you practice temperance and staying somewhat informed of significant social events. Investment makes your time worth more because it's more free; you can do whatever else you want while it works.

Speculation (trading) is also not consistent with investment's intended function for the beneficiary. They are supposed to receive your money and then basically enjoy the benefits of having more money: having some assurance that some initiative juice is available to fund business objectives. But a speculator's goal is to time the market&mdash;by the time the investee is ready to take out some cash, the trusty speculating investor has retracted it. Only when the beneficiary doesn't need money will the (seasoned) speculator be offering.

So basically I think trading is short-sighted and can't in good faith encourage it, though I do admit it's pretty awesome.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading. You'll notice that their implications extend beyond just where they were first considered.

1. Since everyone is wrong at least sometimes, you should prepare to be wrong about anything, even your deeply held convictions. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabalistic mindset is the best framework for posturing yourself to handle constant uncertainty. You never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people are really bothered by needing to admit wrongness, but that's a silly habit that should be unlearned. It's perfectly okay to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. Not a single person or thing, ever, has been right about everything. So nobody has good reason to pretend they know all the answers and can't possibly be wrong. Paradoxically, it's people who are willing to admit wrongness who can ultimately achieve more complete understandings because they adapt by collecting the relevant facts to repair their misconceptions; they embrace wrongness to become more right. They're also more likeable, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible wrongness and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. If you're not sure about something, just do half. This simple heuristic is surprisingly effective. You can keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's a bit too much doubt, or make other arbitrarily sized partial bets that better match your appetite for risk. Again, given the constant threat of uncertainty, you must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. Frequently adjusting commitment to various plans based on rolling efficacy metrics works well to provide exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while ensuring a minimum number of disasters.

3. "Experts" are wrong all the time! If you pay attention (i.e., study data you personally collected or received from a reputable source), you will notice all kinds of patterns that disprove financial "common knowledge." Analyst upgrades/downgrades are not good predictors of accelerated growth/collapses. Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. Most egregiously, the market is clearly _not_ efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after not 1 or 2 rolls of the dice but thousands, year after year? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) And a Buffett-like strategy may have been effective 50 years ago, but an [in-depth presentation from a pro trader](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) or growth investor quickly illuminates how vastly inferior value investing is to momentum-based strategies in the market now. To be fair, experts are partly wrong so often in finance because there is a direct incentive to trick other participants into having the wrong view (so they will take your bet and you win). But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread. (Increasingly, sadly.) Don't believe something just because so-and-so said it. Research it genuinely and you will know the answer.
