Speculative short-term ownership. I spent about 3.5 years in love with this seemingly simple concept. I adored it, then felt disillusioned by it, and ultimately came to a complex opinion, both strongly positive and negative, which I describe here.

**The Positive**

Trading is a psychological war zone, swarming with traps to provoke harmful emotions, like fear or greed or anger, that elicit irrational, fatal decisions. Meanwhile, it promises to grant life-changing freedom to those who are impartial, analytical, and disciplined.

An extreme, even beautiful, game which seems almost like a dojo for training rationality.

The best parts:

-   **Fair**. Consider the issue of personal discrimination: if you don't go to work one day, or you're a convicted felon, or even if you're a woman, a person may certainly act differently knowing that about you. Not your online broker. They're incentivized to serve everyone and will generally do that. You, as a result of trading's objective governance, always have the freedom to work and further yourself if you have capital. So making good decisions today is all that matters, not past decisions or things outside of your control, like age, skin color, etc. Yes, manipulation and insider trading are rampant and make the market less fair, but those surprisingly don't diminish the prize pool much for honest players.

-   **Accommodating**. There's enough opportunity in the market to succeed wildy utilizing any number of possible tactics from a broad spectrum. Some strategies definitely suck, but a huge number are viable. You can adjust trade durations, risk, niche, relevant data, dress code, etc. of the practice as needed or desired. (Unless trading for a job or other external organization that imposes its own rules, of course. All benefits are most applicable when trading independently.)

-   **Economically Efficient**. (Not markets themselves a la [EMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) but the practice of trading in them.) Trading gives decisive, motivating results. You either really succeed and are rewarded a ton for doing something well, or you really fail and are forced to adapt or quit by the pain of idly hemorrhaging money. Everyone is strongly incentivized to work on what they're good at, or get better fast if they've found it but are still failing. All (competitive) jobs should be that way, but most currently can't because they exist under bureaucracies that safeguard VIPs from failure, e.g., incompetent CEOs who won't get fired. Even billionaire traders [flunk out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator) if they screw up.

These are basically about **meritocracy and rationality**, things any serious person should want. Well-invested effort is the only consistent source of reward. That doesn't change no matter who your parents are, what they did or didn't do for you, or other factors you don't control. People are taught that everyone deserves to put in effort, and when they do, great things will happen. It's the ideal framework for motivating people to try their best.

Trading is crazy, unpredictable, and exhilarating. Through all the headache-inducing blinking lights, screenshotting charts, tediously scoring the sensibility of all my transactions from 1-to-10, spreadsheets, etc., I was rarely bored. I think it came more naturally to me than most things, which added to the fun and eventual stew of mixed feelings.

**The Negative**

Trading is isolating and depressing, especially if you **1)** work independently and/or **2)** are not good at meeting people through non-work channels. How much is there really to discuss about the work anyway? "Number went up today! Down yesterday..." The only people who will ever understand or care about what you do are other traders, and they probably won't care either unless they think there is something to learn from you. If you decide to play, better play to win!

It's an inefficient means to personal development since it solves only 1 problem while other jobs solve 2. Trading 99%+ of the time has the exclusive purpose of generating money, which also occurs from doing intrinsically valuable work, like flying planes, cooking food, etc. When you can get by _and_ accomplish something, or just get by, why choose the latter? Yeah, "more money," which could make sense in certain situations, but consider carefully and honestly to what extent more money would really improve the quality of your life, and what tradeoffs must be made to get it. Feeling like your work matters is a very nice mental health benefit that should, if at all possible, not be forsaken.

It's simple, you rinse-and-repeat the same plan every day and rarely need to use your imagination. That's nice... for a bit. Then it's boring. Maybe you prefer routine workflows, which is fine, but there are still more useful and intellectually stimulating options for non-creative and/or routinized practices: tech support, consulting, medicine, etc. The diverse experiences and continued learning opportunities in those are probably both more fun and more beneficial to a lifetime career than learning to game a soulless transaction system. It's possible to learn to experience life more fully through trading, but real jobs are better suited to instill that type of wisdom. (The irony of putting this in the "lessons from trading" section is not lost on me.)

Some will say you can/should first make money however necessary and then retire to do all the fun or altruistic things. Or that trading should be there as a fallback option while you figure it out or while work is scarce. Or that it just isn't anyone's business to pass judgment about how others manage their lives and resources... These are excuses to be lazy and let culture rot. There are way too many creative, useful, fun, and lucrative opportunities for it to be worth living trapped in pointless minutiae at a heavy [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost).

So while I admit that trading can be great, I discourage it.

That said, investing&mdash;related but different topic&mdash;is very legitimate and worthwhile, mainly since it doesn't (or shouldn't) take up all of your time so there is not such an opportunity cost. It's the opposite of that: it saves you time, making that time more free and therefore worth more.

**&mdash;Anyhow&mdash;**

Here are some things I learned from trading.

1. Everyone is wrong sometimes and will always be at risk of being wrong. Not only are we often wrong, but we also can't often predict what we'll be wrong about and when. Since no one's judgment is infallible, we should prepare to be wrong about anything, even deeply held convictions, and should never act under total faith that something in particular, failing to be unambiguously proven, must be right. Rather than complete faith in your best guess, a probabilistic mindset is the best framework for posturing to navigate this constant uncertainty. You'll never lose everything, literally or figuratively, by turning out to be wrong. Some people hate to acknowledge their own wrongness but that's a dumb and insidious habit that should be unlearned. It's fine to be wrong, just not to stay wrong. And importantly, aversion to wrongness will make you _more_ wrong. Admitting and embracing incorrectness, paradoxically, leads to consistent correctness. Open-mindedness admits new, relevant facts that can adapt misconceptions. Open-minded people are also more fun, frankly. Having no humility to admit fault or compromise is insufferable. In trading and elsewhere, accepting possible errors and moving on gracefully is a superpower.

2. The function for growth is exponential (assuming past growth aids future growth, which should always be true in a game unless it's truly random or you make progress inefficiently). Therefore, because of the math in exponential compounding, it's more important to be consistent in your growth than to be optimized. As we see in [asymptotic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Infinite_asymptotics) of algorithms and the number of steps needed to run them, over time, the exponent term of the highest order within the growth rate function dominates in formulating its outputs. Whatever single value multiplier is achieved through one standout iteration, it can always be achieved much more quickly/easily through repeated multiplication (exponentiation). So significant setbacks that prevent participation, removing iterations (lowering the order of any exponent in this hypothetical growth function), obstruct growth much more than failing to capture all daily value (decreasing term coefficients). This reveals a fundamental asymmetry between success and failure: the biggest successes never come from one trade or day at work, but from the protracted compounding of marginal wins. The exponent starts low&mdash;the first few iterations. You can only grow so fast even if you work tirelessly and make perfect decisions. That's why it just takes time, to build the capital to trade flexibly, or to form the neural pathways to know how to practice something effectively, etc. before your work begins to self-amplify. Even if you are proficient, motivated, and otherwise capable, binge-practicing (or -studying, -building, -playing, etc.) can still cause burnout and the desire to detach, causing fewer iterations. So you can't shortcut huge success. But, you can instantly lose everything ([and more!](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)>)) in one bad trading day or meltdown. Thus, threats of failure should take priority over prospects for success. Focus on consistency and whatever it takes to attain it, optimize only with what's leftover. There are a lot of opportunities... way more than enough to get what you want. No need to doom yourself by getting overly attached to any of them. I take this as an abstract lesson to try to put mental health first and break often, even if it means slowing down, so that things stay fun and I'm not tempted to quit.

3. A simple and surprisingly effective heuristic: if unsure, just do half. You might keep it super simple and do exactly half every time there's too much doubt, or make arbitrarily sized partial bets in tune with your shifting audacity. With [constant uncertainty](.#:~:text=Everyone%20is%20wrong,constant%20uncertainty.), we must accept that any perception and any plan is fallible. If you [consider decisions with non-monetary outcomes to also be bets](../quotes#:~:text="Everyone,Thinking), which they absolutely are, then we're always making bets in a sense, and our bets need not (and should not) often be all-or-nothing. Frequent adjustments to various plans, based on rolling efficacy metrics and even gut feelings, provide healthy exposure to the benefits of risk and diversity while minimizing disasters.

4. "Experts" are wrong _all the time_. Pay attention (study data you manually collected or received from a reputable source), and you'll notice all kinds of patterns that fly in the face of financial and other "common knowledge." Trend reversals always occur as public sentiment is strongest in the opposing direction. The market is clearly not efficient and immune to being predicted. (How do you explain that some outperform the market average after thousands of rolls of the dice, year after year, performing manual analysis with no unfair advantage? I will never understand how EMH advocates manage to ignore this glaring contradiction.) Value investing a la Buffett may have been a dominant strategy 50 years ago but is now, in the volatile post-2010s market, vastly inferior to [momentum-based strategies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx8GvtAxilk) utilized in growth investing and [day/swing](https://stokestrades.com/day-trading-vs-swing-trading/) trading. And usually, despite scarily steep ascents amidst fearful chatter, the market chugs on healthily. For an embarrassingly long time, I was a frustrated perma-bear convinced that the bull market following the 2008 crisis must be exaggerated and would surely crash any second. I finally overcame this by shutting my ears to other opinions and focusing exclusively on my own organic data. Turns out the market often looks like a fragile, precarious Jenga tower throughout history... To be fair, experts are partly wrong so much in finance because they're incentivized to trick other participants into being wrong. Those traders pay them their paycheck. But even outside finance's unique zero-sum incentives, misinformation is widespread (increasingly, sadly). Don't _believe_ something just because so-and-so said it, research it genuinely and you will _know_ the answer.

5. There are natural ups and downs, react accordingly. (This may be more or less relevant to you personally but overall is inevitable.) Good days and bad days. Typically they cluster together, so when a couple bad days happen at once, expect more. What that means in finance is, "when you start losing more, place smaller bets." The opposite also holds: on a hot streak, it's rational to size-up bets because skill and resulting performance truly do increase along with confidence. It's no different anywhere else: do less of what doesn't work and more of what does. On paper, this advice seems too reactionary and not predictive enough to forecast optimal posturing in the present, but it works pretty well... this touches on another useful guideline: simple is best.
