I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have broad interests and volatile interest in them, so I aim to specialize in generalizing.

My #1 goal is to make information as available and as precise as it can be for all interested people. My focus here is on evolving self-education technology. In particular, I'm building an extremely efficient, simple search engine and social bookmarking page at [FITM](https://fitm.online)&mdash;and filling it with awesome Internet treasure!

My #2 goal is to help proliferate curiosity and joy around learning and experiencing more of the world. For that I try to help promote topics that I enjoy or think are important.
