I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have broad interests and volatile preoccupations with each. Thus, I've settled for specializing in generalizing.

Current Projects:

-   Helping to fill [FITM](https://fitm.online) with Internet treasure
-   Journaling here

For fun, I like to:

-   listen to podcasts
-   read nonfiction
-   explore spontaneous curiosity rabbit holes
-   write about things I enjoy
-   doodle on the guitar
-   experiment with cooking
-   clack my arcade stick to some UMvC3

To get a better sense for who I am, consider exploring my [Ranking List of Everything](../rankings/) or [Tribute to my Idols](../idols/)
