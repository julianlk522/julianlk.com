I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have many interests, but the bulk tends to converge around the topics of education and technology.

When it comes to programming, I am most experienced with:

-   Python (3 YoE)
-   JavaScript / TypeScript (2.5 YoE)
-   CSS (2.5 YoE)
-   SQL (2 YoE)
-   Go (~1 YoE)
-   Bash (-lt 1 YoE)

Right now I'm working on:

-   Launching [FITM](https://fitm.online) and helping to fill it with Internet treasure that everyone should be able to easily find
-   Decking out this website, particularly:
    -   [Tech](../tech/) and [Tech QnA](../tech-qna/)
    -   [Heroes](../heroes/)

My goals for current projects are mainly to:

-   help people find all of the best online sources
    -   utilities, guides, references, readings, videos, ...
-   help connect people (myself included) over mutual appreciations

For fun, I like listening to podcasts, reading nonfiction, struggling with the guitar, cooking different foods from around the world, and spending quality time with my girlfriend, Sneha, and our 2 wonderful cats, Kulfi and Jamun. I am also a _huge_ UMvC3 fan.
