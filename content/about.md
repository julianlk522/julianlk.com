My name is Julian Lindsay-Kaufman.

I am interested in many things. Right now mostly:

-   Launching FITM
-   Decking out this website

My goal with these projects is to help people find amazing sources online and to help myself and others connect over shared interests.

For fun, I play UMvC3. I also like listening to podcasts, struggling to play the guitar, reading nonfiction, cooking worldly foods, and spending quality time with my girlfriend, Sneha, and our 2 wonderful cats, Kulfi and Jamun.
