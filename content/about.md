I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have broad interests and volatile interest in them. There are way too many topics worthy of attention, so I aim to specialize in generalizing.

My paramount goal is to help proliferate curiosity and joy for learning, and empower people to be more knowledgeable. To that end, I strive on two levels to increase information availability and make education fun:

-   subjectively, by promoting topics I enjoy
-   systematically, by building and improving self-education tools

<b>For a better sense of who I am, consider reading [Ranking List of Everything](../rankings/) or [Tribute to my Idols](../idols/)</b>

<br>

Current Projects:

-   Filling [FITM](https://fitm.online) with Internet treasure
