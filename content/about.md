I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have broad interests and volatile interest in them. I think there are way too many worthy preoccupations to not be some sort of generalist. Thus, I intend to specialize in generalizing. I'm interested in learning to learn better, and in improving information availability.

As such, some of my favorite hobbies are to:

-   listen to podcasts
-   read nonfiction
-   explore spontaneous curiosity rabbit holes
-   discover new lifestyle supercharge techniques through coding and I.T.
-   write about things I enjoy

But I also have fun:

-   doodling on the guitar
-   testing new cooking experiments
-   mashing some buttons in UMvC3

Current Projects:

-   Helping to fill [FITM](https://fitm.online) with Internet treasure
