I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have broad interests and volatile interest in them, so I aim to specialize in generalizing.

My #1 goal is to make general information as accessible and as precise as it can be for anyone who wants it. My focus is on self-education technology. In particular, I'm building an extremely efficient, simple search engine and social bookmarking page at [FITM](https://fitm.online)&mdash;and filling it with awesome Internet treasure!

My #2 goal is, through no specific means, to spread cool concepts that inspire people. I love to hunt for, explore, and share the works of great thinkers. I also love to experiment and devise exciting possibilities myself, usually within music, computer programming, and _Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3_. My obsessions change over the years, but I suspect these will stay favorites forever.
