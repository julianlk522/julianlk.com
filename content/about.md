I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have many interests. Right now they mostly center around education and technology. There is huge potential in combining those, and I think often about how to best do it.

I'm currently working on:

-   Helping to fill [FITM](https://fitm.online) with Internet treasure
-   Adding to this website:
    -   Researching for [Tech](../tech/) and [Tech QnA](../tech-qna/)
    -   Celebrating my [Idols](../idols/)

For fun, I like listening to podcasts, reading nonfiction, struggling with the guitar, cooking different foods from around the world, writing about things I enjoy, and spending quality time with my girlfriend, Sneha, and our 2 wonderful cats, Kulfi and Jamun. I am also a _huge_ UMvC3 fan.
