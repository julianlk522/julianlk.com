I like to learn about the world and cool things people have done.

My particular interests are volatile so I aim to specialize in generalizing.

<br>

My #1 goal is, through no specific means, to contribute to the exchange of exciting, inspiring ideas.

My #2 goal is to make general information as accessible and precise as it can be for whoever wants it.
