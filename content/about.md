I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have many interests. Right now mostly:

-   Launching [FITM](https://fitm.online) and filling it with Internet treasure that everyone should be able to easily find.
-   Decking out this website, particularly:
    -   [Heroes](../heroes/)
    -   [Tech](../tech/)

My goals with current projects are primarily to :

-   help people find amazing sources online
-   help connect people (myself included) over mutual fascinations

For fun, I play a lot of UMvC3. I also like listening to podcasts, struggling with the guitar, reading nonfiction, cooking worldly foods, and spending quality time with my girlfriend, Sneha, and our 2 wonderful cats, Kulfi and Jamun.
