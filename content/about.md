I'm Julian Lindsay-Kaufman. Nice to meet you!

I have many interests. Right now they mostly center around education and technology.

I'm currently working on:

-   Helping to fill [FITM](https://fitm.online) with Internet treasure
-   Adding to this website:
    -   Researching for [Tech](../tech/) and [Tech QnA](../tech-qna/)
    -   Celebrating my [Idols](../idols/)

<br>

For fun, I like listening to podcasts, reading nonfiction, struggling with the guitar, cooking different foods from around the world, and writing about things I enjoy. I am also a huge UMvC3 fan.
