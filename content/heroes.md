This page is an open letter of gratitude to some of my favorite people ever. For a handful of reasons, I really admire everyone here and they have significantly influenced my hopes and dreams.

My goal is both to thank those listed and to share with any other readers what I find so remarkable about them.

### Ron Jarzombek

[Ron Jarzombek](http://www.ronjarzombek.com/) is, easily, one of the most creative and dedicated musicians whose work I know of. I am a fan especially of his band _Blotted Science_.

One thing that separates Ron from other guitarists is his history of scoring songs to film. _The Animation of Entomology_, for example, is exceptionally unique not only for being [entirely scored to horror films](https://www.reddit.com/r/progmetal/comments/18n8k99/ive_reconstructed_blotted_science_the_animation/), but for using bugs as the main horrific element compared to the usual violent stuff you find in metal. But his music is not thematically limited to horror. I was lucky to discover [The Cereal Mouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RztR4E12dGU) as a kid because someone had [charted it to Tap Tap Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woP3CtkvBkI) as a playable track. That song is scored to a scene from Charlotte's Web and has a completely different sound from Blotted Science. It's whimsical and uplifting while having all of Ron's characteristic technical chops. For sounding so unorthodox, it's delightfully coherent. Pretty much only Ron can pull off writing a song like that.

Beyond the unbelievable guitar-playing and song-writing virtuosity, Ron has produced a ton of free and publicly available educational content about his music and the processes behind it. He has also written and released much of the tablature for his songs for free. You can find all of that on [Ron's website](http://www.ronjarzombek.com/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/ronjarz).

### Annie Rauwerda (Depths Of Wikipedia)

[Depths Of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depths_of_Wikipedia) (DoW) highlights pockets of particularly great content on Wikipedia and shares it publicly across social media platforms. Annie Rauwerda created DoW during the Covid lockdown and it has since reached a large audience.

I enjoy the quirky fun facts, but my appreciation for Annie and DoW goes deeper. She is working hard to help to solve the problem of "unknown unknowns" which I think is a seriously worthwhile goal. In other words, she is teaching to a variety of interests and helping people to exceed prior perspective constraints by discovering new topics of understanding, not just drilling deeper into familiar territory.

Reducing "unknown unknowns" is an essential part of education. It's hard to do alone, though, since being unaware of a concept usually means being unable to effectively educate yourself on it. So we are reliant on social learning for that, somewhat (though LLMs, particularly Claude, are getting really good at helping too). The onus is mainly on great teachers to interpolate which missing concepts would be most useful to their students and teach them. It's great to see any skilled teacher step up to that challenge. But, arguably, Annie's work with DoW has affected many more students, through a broader range of topics, than the typical teacher can.

Guiding viewers to fun and interesting phenomena on Wikipedia is an excellent way to reduce "unknown unknowns." Annie's influence with DoW is an inspiration to FITM.

### Mark Minervini

"FinTwit" was a deceptive community, in my experience. A lot of users were inactive, unprofessional, or plainly mean (nothing by 2024 Twitter standards). But a handful of knowledgeable, magnanimous voices made it, overall, a forest of investment wisdom. From about 2018-2021, my period of active stock trading and keeping up there, Mark Minervini stands out as a paragon of excellence and honor from the FinTwit world. Despite the usual Twitter personalities, Mark returned to the trenches week after week to encourage new and/or struggling traders with thoughtful and powerful words. [Here's one](https://x.com/markminervini/status/1655534300064894977) of many such tweets as an example.

Mark's trading journey is unique. He learned about speculation in the 1980s as an independent, uneducated (dropped out of high school) rock drummer. He struggled for years while self-teaching, analyzing quote data he recorded by hand from newspapers. (Bear in mind that at this time it was also common for buy/sell commissions to cost a few hundred dollars each.) He endured the difficulty for about 6 years and started crawling into profitability. In 1997 Mark became the US Investing Champion, and again in 2021. Several of his students in the Minervini Private Access program have also ranked highly in USIC competitions.

Outside of trading and mentoring, Mark is the author of several books about his trading approaches and his thoughts about building a good life. I have read [Trade Like a Stock Market Wizard](https://www.amazon.com/Trade-Like-Stock-Market-Wizard/dp/0071807225/), which was enjoyable and informative. He also likes to [jam out on the drums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj6VzfDPTfo).

If you are someone like Mark, it's probably tempting to relax and enjoy the life you've made. Still, he continues to cheer on fans, many anonymous, and drive them to give their best to trading and beyond. He seems truly delighted to see everyone else win, in their own way, and for that I love seeing him win too.

### Justin Wong

Justin Wong is different from a lot of the heroes on this page. He's not an educator per se, but his achievements have educated fans on the limitless potential of practice and determination. He is a professional fighting game player who I came to know as an icon in the community of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, my favorite video game ever.

In the early years of "Mahvel"'s life, Justin was a frequent finalist in tournaments. Despite being [infamously unbeatable](https://www.evo.gg/news/a-brief-history-of-marvel-vs-capcom-at-evo) in the previous edition of the series, Justin was often considered an underdog in Marvel 3. It's frankly not a very fair game, and tactics to produce nearly riskless victories were, even in 2013, well-known. Many abused these strategies against Justin but he (almost) never ceded and joined them. He stuck to a relatively fair team, making it harder for himself. Why? I believe it comes from the opinion, which I agree with, that the process of really earning a victory is more important than just getting one.

(You might be thinking, "that sounds like a bad game if it's so unfair," and you would be right. But it's also an amazing game for reasons I won't get into here.)

Still, Justin often came out ahead, through incredible skill and some other mysterious force. A name was given to it: the "Wong Factor." The phenomenon which caused him to suddenly, in the most dire and hopeless moments, make the exact decisions and executions needed to clutch a game. Beholding the Wong Factor in the finals of Evolution 2013 and 2014 was like experiencing magic happen. I honestly consider it a defining moment of my life. It was an immaculate display of talent but, more importantly, it was a broadcast to the world that nothing is impossible.

Years later, I still occasionally replay Justin's old matches from that era. If he did that, what else might be possible that few believe in?

### Tim Ferriss

[Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/) does a lot of things, but personally I am most grateful for the effort he has put into _The Tim Ferriss Show_. Like [Annie Rauwerda]({{< ref "/heroes#annie-rauwerda-depths-of-wikipedia">}}), Tim does a spectacular job of offering people fun ways to shed "unknown unknowns." His podcasts are typically interviews/conversations, and guests come from a range of backgrounds. Of the handful of podcasts I have tested, it is by far the one with the highest average episode quality.

What makes Tim's podcast so good? A mix of interesting subject matter (for virtually all tastes), great questions (often the same or variations... because they work well), focused conversions with few detours, a willingness to congratulate and empower rivals (the opposite suggests selfish ulterior motives and is a red flag, in my opinion) and, often, a sincerity between speakers that other podcasts lack.

Tim is the author of several great books and has recommended others (both directly and indirectly, e.g., by inviting a guest who recommends one) that I have also loved. A few noteworthy recommendations were [_Vagabonding_](https://rolfpotts.com/books/vagabonding/) by Rolf Potts and [_Anything You Want_](https://sive.rs/a) by Derek Sivers. His own works tend to focus on performance optimization but, compared to alternatives in that genre, also offer a refreshing dose of humor and good spirit. He is very transparent about personal struggles, endeavoring not to portray the typical image of the "unflappable juggernaut" (his words) self-help coach. That authenticity breeds approachable and energizing writing, I think. Tim's deft word choice (see aforementioned example) is always a treat and has drawn me to attempt more writing too.

### Paul Graham

[Paul Graham](https://www.paulgraham.com/) (PG) is someone else whose brilliant creative influence has nudged me to start writing more in public. PG has [written a lot](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) on his own website. Those essays are an absolute goldmine of clear and practical ideas. A few that I especially like are _How to Write Usefully_, _How to Do What You Love_, and _Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule_. I don't know of another writer having both the technical experience and the appetite for dissecting psychology and human behavior that PG has. If you are a hacker type who likes to think beyond pixels sometimes, and you haven't already sampled his articles, be sure to check them out.

Aside from incredible essays, PG is responsible for creating [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), one of my favorite and most-visited Internet sites. (Fun fact: the HN backend is written in Arc, a dialect of the Lisp programming language which PG authored. It is possibly the only use of Arc used in production code today&mdash;I don't know of another, at least, but please [correct me](../contact/) if you know of any.) He is also well known for his role at YCombinator, locating important nascent startups and helping them to bring dreams to reality. I don't tend to glorify venture capital, but I really like some companies/nonprofits that YC has backed (Reddit and [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/about/), for instance).

Despite massive success, PG is humble, compassionate, and eager to see others succeed. Maybe being a father helps to cultivate that positivity. I really respect his commitment to broadly improving quality of life through startup advising and openly sharing his thoughtful excerpts with the world.

### Terry Crews

Terry Crews hardly needs an introduction. What do I admire so much about him that has got him featured here? Terry has spoken openly about his journey to [overcome toxic aggression](https://www.amazon.com/Tough-My-Journey-True-Power/dp/0593329805). It's no surprise that he wound up that way (abusive father, football player lauded for toughness), but it is incredible who Terry has become since then. He has not only undone his tendency for violence, but has become an icon of love and joy among fans.

Admitting fault is difficult, especially at core identity level. For Terry to voluntarily give up toughness, a key ingredient in the recipe for his fame and success, in order to align with higher ideals and live happily, is a real show of character. I can't understate the importance, nor the difficulty, of such a choice.

Terry, like most people on this list, is someone who had ample chances to sell out but never did. He could have found other partners after his affair was discovered, without internally reconciling the crime of infidelity. He could have continued to live violently, especially since it is arguably a virtue in competitive football. He has been offered an easier but less honorable life many times over, and has instead chosen to become a role model for the community, particularly for men who battle the addiction of feeling tough.
