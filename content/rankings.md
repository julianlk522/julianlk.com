#### well, almost everything.

These are my ratings (0-10) of _how great it is to know_ of and more or less _understand_ each thing, perhaps by _experiencing_ it.

They are not ratings of _efficacy_ at something. This is best explained with an example: Carolina Reaper chilis. Highly effective at summoning mouthfuls of misery. If you don't enjoy that&mdash;like most people&mdash; you are equally well-off with or without them, so they should likely be rated about a 5. (Maybe the peppers deserve more credit - I haven't tried them.)
