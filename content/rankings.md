#### well, almost everything.

These are my ratings (0-10) of _how great it is to know_ of and more or less _understand_ each thing, perhaps by experiencing it.

These are not ratings of subjecive _efficacy_. An illustrative example: Carolina Reaper chilis. Highly effective at summoning mouthfuls of misery. If you don't enjoy that&mdash;like most people&mdash; you are equally well-off with or without that power. So despite them being very potent, their rating should be about 5, or neutral. (Maybe they deserve more credit - I don't particularly want to find out.)
