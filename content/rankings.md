#### well, a lot of things, at least.

These can be thought of as ratings (0-10) of how great it is to _know of_ and more or less _understand_ each item, perhaps by _experiencing_ it.

They are _not_ ratings of efficacy at what each thing sets out to do. Something may fulfill its purpose very well but that purpose isn't always relevant or wanted. Carolina Reaper chilis: superbly effective at summoning a mouthful of fiery misery. The people who don't enjoy that&mdash;most people&mdash; are equally well-off with or without having any exposure to Carolina Reapers, so they should be rated about a 5. (Though I haven't given them a proper try, so to be safe they're not officially rated yet.) Wikipedia (9.5), however, is life-changingly positive to be aware of; Microsoft Word (4.9) is slightly upsetting; allergies (0) are just downright horrible with nothing to appreciate. Fortunately most things are nicer than allergies.
