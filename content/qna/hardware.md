## Why do computers need a CPU and a GPU?

CPUs excel at processing different instruction sets rapidly. GPUs are better suited for similar but complex instructions involving massively parallel math, like updating graphics displays in real time or executing machine learning.

Strictly speaking, both a CPU and GPU are not needed simultaneously for a computer to function. A CPU could (eventually) process what the GPU does, and vice-versa, but it would be very slow.
