This page is a collection of questions that I had about various tech concepts and the best answers that I could give now, to my earlier self and to any other curious readers, to help it make sense. Topics are ones which I found especially confusing or not suitable to be answered by a quick Google search.

These writings also serve as notes to help me learn and for future reference.

More topics will be added over time.

As always, if you see something false, please [let me know](mailto:julianlindsaykaufman@gmail.com). I try hard to fact-check everything but am not perfect.
