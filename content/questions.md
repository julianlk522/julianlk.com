Questions that I am currently stumped by and hope to find better answers to, some day.

#### What is the right balance to strike in life between a) effortful expansion of human (and non-human) opportunity and b) effortless consumption of known delights? In lieu of a perfect answer, can a better answer be determined than just, "whatever you think it is?"

I think, at the very least, it is safe to say that neither deserves your full devotion.

#### Is it even possible for a broad population like the United States, guided by a widely varying set of morals, to be _effectively_ governed under one set of rules?
